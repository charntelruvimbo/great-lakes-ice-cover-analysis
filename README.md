# Great Lakes Ice Cover Analysis  

## Project Overview
This project investigates long-term trends in annual ice cover on the Great Lakes using inferential statistical analysis.  
The goal was to determine whether changes in ice coverage over the past several decades can be explained by random variation or if there is evidence of a systematic trend consistent with climate change.

## Objectives
- Construct a yearly measure of ice cover using daily percent ice coverage data  
- Explore long-term patterns in ice coverage over multiple decades  
- Apply inferential statistical methods to test for the presence of a trend  
- Account for autocorrelation, non-linear behavior, and variability in the data  
- Produce visualizations and a reproducible statistical report  

## Data
The dataset contains daily percent ice cover values for the Great Lakes, where rows represent days of the year and columns represent individual years.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and restructuring in R  
- Construction of annual ice cover metrics from daily observations  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Bootstrap resampling to estimate variability and confidence intervals  
- Time series and trend analysis across years  
- Inferential statistical testing for long-term change  
- Reproducible reporting using R Markdown  

## Tools Used
- R  
- R Markdown  
- tidyverse  
- dplyr  
- ggplot2  
- bootstrap / resampling methods  
- time series analysis  

## Results
The analysis examined whether ice cover on the Great Lakes has changed over time and evaluated the strength of the observed trend using formal statistical methods.  
Results provide evidence of systematic variation in ice coverage across years, highlighting the importance of monitoring long-term environmental changes.
